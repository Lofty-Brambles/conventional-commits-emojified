A commit-formatter tool built to make sweet-looking commit messages :D

This was heavily inspired by the Conventional commits, Angular commit conventions, Commitizen and Gitmojis.

I needed a tool that wasn't something serious, but let me structure my commits in a neat, and de-facto format, so I wrote a teeny CLI. Currently, it's far from what I want, in terms of customisation, but I plan on coming back to it soon!

## Features

- Standardises your commits with an unique message structure.
- Follows conventional commits but with emojis!

## Plans

- Ability to bind the letter count on commit messages.
- Ability to add case-checking and formatting to the commit messages.
- Ability to structure your own commit messages.
- Turning the initial commit into a structured one as well.
- Allowing further actions to look cooler.
